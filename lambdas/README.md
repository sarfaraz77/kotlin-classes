🎃 Trick or Treat — Kotlin Lambdas & Function Types

This project helped me understand function types, lambdas, and higher-order functions in Kotlin using a simple “trick or treat” example.

What it demonstrates

Functions can be stored in variables

Functions can be returned from other functions

Lambdas are just functions without names

Function types like (Int) -> String and () -> Unit

How behavior can be selected at runtime

Core idea

trickOrTreat() does not perform an action — it returns a function (trick or treat) based on a Boolean flag.
The returned function is then executed later.

This separation between:

choosing behavior

running behavior

is the key to understanding lambdas and higher-order functions.

This pattern is used everywhere in real Kotlin:

Button click handlers

Callbacks

Sorting, filtering, mapping

Android UI logic

Learning this made Kotlin’s functional style finally click for me.
