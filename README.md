# Kotlin Fundamentals

This repository contains my Kotlin learning journey — core language concepts, syntax, and problem-solving examples.

It includes:

- Classes & objects

- Lambdas & function types

- 

Each folder represents a topic, with simple .kt files that show how the concept works in practice.

This repo tracks my progress as I build a strong Kotlin foundation for Android and backend development.
